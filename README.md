# SoftwareCollaborationFederation

A Remote Build Server application which supports continuation Integration using C#.

The main goal of the project is to develop an Asynchronous distributed build server system which builds multiple c# and c++ test libraries in parallel by process pooling and automates testing process for all the built test libraries. 

The system consists of a repository, build-server system, test harness system, and a client system. These systems interact with each other using message passing communication.
